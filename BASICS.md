### The Automation Conundrum
- Why do we need automation
- What is best automation framework for me?
- How do I decide on the automation tools?

### Need for Test Automation
- Increasing complexities in testing environment
- Demand for Higher speed and Accuracy of testing processess
- Aggressive release schedules and Tight budgets
- Reduction in the overall risk
- A cost-efficient way to increase application reliability, reduce the time and cost of software quality programs

### Good Candidates
- short or simple transaction
- Many data combinations
- Expected results are stable or easy to generate at runtime
- Test that are executed regulary
- Task that are difficult to do manually
- Highest proprity features

### Poor Canditates
- Long or complex transactions
- One-offs
- Unstable or difficult to predict results
- Test that cross multiple applications

### Features of Automation framefork
- Well defined architectural design
- Less time to test large data
- Script execution in multiple environments
- Easier, faster and efficient analysis of result logs
- Communication of resutls
- Easy debugging and script maintenance
- Robust and Stable due to error and exception handling
- 100 % Releability of Utility scripts, oneline execution, report packs

### Introduction of framework - an introduction to robot framework

Record: Automation tool  <-- Captures GUI Object properties, images and Text --> GUI
Run: Automation tool --> Verifies GUI object properties, Images and Text --> GUI


| Data Table | Automation tool | Application | 
| ---------- |:---------------:|------------:|
|  Create Data table with the data identified based on the test conditions | Extraction and Validation of Data from the Excel sheei using automation Tool | Tool Populates the Data into the application and preforms the checks | 

### Keyword Driven and  Scriptless  Test Automation

| Keywords | Automation tool | Application |
| --------:|:---------------:|------------:|
| Crete Keywords with no or minimal code | Parser and executes the keywords for each test case | Calls the supporting libraries to perform action on the application |

### Robot Framework Process Flow
- Trigger the test case(s) to be executed from inside Robot Framework
- Robot in turn calls the keyword for each test case
- Executes the intended functionality with the help of reusable scripts and support libraries
- Stores the results, data and screenshots, in respective folders
- Closes add data tables, sreens / GUI's, browsers and applications.

### Why Robot Framework?
- Generic Test automation framework for acceptance Testing
- Keyword Driven Approach
- Contains both Internal and External test libraries
- The core framework is implelented using Python
- User can create new higher-level keywords from existing ones

### Why Pobot test automation framework as compared to other available frameworks?
- Open Source
- No Requirement for writing code
- Supports Web-based, API and Desktop application testing
- Clear Reports and Detailed logs
- Supports creating data-driven test cases.
- Enables easy integrationn with source control

### Benefits / Outcomes the course
- Expertise in test automation
- End to End test cases development
- Experience on Web-based, API and desktop automation
- Hands on practice on Live projects
- Help on Robot Framework automation interview questins
